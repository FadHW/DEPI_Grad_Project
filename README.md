# 🚦 DEPI Graduation Project
## Egyptian Road & Railway Accidents Analysis (2024)

This repository contains our DEPI (Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative) Graduation Project, focused on data analysis, KPI extraction, and interactive dashboard development using Power BI.  

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project analyzes the dataset:  
  "حوادث السيارات والقطارات 2024"
Translation: Car and Train Accidents – 2024  

The dataset contains official Egyptian accident records for the year 2024, covering:  
  - 🚗 Road (Car) Accidents  
  - 🚆 Railway (Train) Accidents
    
Our goal was to transform raw accident data into actionable insights that support:  
  - Data-driven decision making  
  - Risk analysis and severity evaluation  
  - Pattern detection and trend analysis  
  - Public safety awareness  

 ##  🎯 Project Objectives  
Clean and preprocess the raw dataset  
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Extract meaningful KPIs  
Identify trends, patterns, and risk factors  
Design an interactive Power BI dashboard  
Present insights in a professional business format  
### 📊 Key KPIs Extracted  
The main KPIs include:   
1. Total number of accidents  
2. Total injuries  
3. Total fatalities  
4. Accident severity rate  
5. Accidents by region  
6. Accidents by time period (monthly / daily trends)  
7. Accidents by vehicle type  
8. Railway vs Road accident comparison  
### 📈 Dashboard Features (Power BI)  
The interactive dashboard includes:  
📍 Geographic distribution of accidents across Egypt  
📅 Time-series analysis (monthly & yearly trends)  
🚗 Accident classification by vehicle type  
⚠️ Severity analysis (injuries vs fatalities)  
🔎 Interactive filters for dynamic data exploration

**The dashboard enables stakeholders to identify:**  
High-risk regions, 
Peak accident periods,
Major contributing factors, and
Severity patterns
